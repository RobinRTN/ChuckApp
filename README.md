# Sport Coaching Management App

Welcome to our **Sport Coaching Management App**, a project born right after completing [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) coding bootcamp. This application was co-created with a friend who managed the business aspects, while I focused on the development side.

## Project Overview

This app offers an all-in-one software solution tailored for sport coaches. It simplifies and automates various tasks, making the life of a coach more efficient and organized.

### Key Features

- **Agenda and Scheduling**: Easy-to-use interface for managing appointments and schedules.
- **Personalized Web Page**: Coaches can create and customize their web pages for a better online presence.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**: Tools to manage client relationships effectively.
- **Administrative Task Automation**: Streamline administrative duties for more focus on coaching.
- **Financial Dashboard**: Track earnings and manage finances with ease.
- **Online Booking**: Clients can book sessions directly through the coach's web page.

### Technical Stack

- **Ruby on Rails**: Full-stack
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Twilio**: Sending Text Messages and emails to users / clients when new booking or update
- **Stimulus.js**: Probably ot the best choice but learned a lot about JS as quite close to vanilla logic
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Ensuring a seamless and app-like user experience on mobile - managed to add the notifications aswell

### Reflections

The backend was a pleasure to work with, offering flexibility and power. However, the front-end complexity escalated due to our choice of tech stack. For todays perspective, I would have definitly picked a React-based front-end to handle the complexity better. This project adheres to the typical stack taught at Le Wagon, serving as a testament to the practical applications of the skills learned there.

### Achievements

- **50 Sport Coaches Onboarded**: A significant milestone that demonstrates the app's utility and appeal.
